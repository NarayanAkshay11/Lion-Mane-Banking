# Lion-Mane-Banking 
This is a Mock Net Banking System created as a CBSE Grade 12 Project by B. Akshay Narayanan. 
The application is built using Python and MySQL. 
The main aim of this project was to showcase the skills and knowledge learnt
from the CBSE syllabus along with some extra knowledge to bridge the gap between the backend and the front end.

# Introduction
Our busy lives make every day a race against the clock, so we look for time-saving
opportunities everywhere. Online banking has reduced the frequency of trips to the bank
for daily errands.
One of the many advantages of online banking is that it is simple to access, but it also
makes banking very convenient. There is no longer a need to wait in a long line at the
bank. When you have e-banking available to you and a reliable budgeting tool at your
disposal, managing your finances and creating a budget are made easier. While making
purchases or calculating your monthly savings and expenses, real-time expenses can be
kept an eye on.

The bank management system offers a range of convenient features for its users,
including the ability to:
• Initiate Transactions
• Check account balance
• View transaction history
• Create a new account
• View loan details
With these tools at your fingertips, you can easily manage your finances and stay on top
of your banking needs.

# Problem Definition
Problem: A bank is in need of a new system to manage its day-to-day operations, including
customer accounts, transactions, and employee records. Currently, the bank is using
manual processes and multiple disconnected systems to handle these tasks, which is
inefficient and prone to errors.
# 
Objective: Develop a new system that streamlines and automates the management of the
bank's operations, improving efficiency and accuracy while also providing a better
experience for customers and employees. The system should be able to handle a large
volume of data and transactions, and should have secure access controls in place to protect
sensitive information. Additionally, the system should be flexible and scalable to
accommodate the bank's future growth and changing needs.
